To build RPM, you need a RPM_HOME.
This can be /usr/src/RPM or any other directory containing all mandatory subdirs.
RPM_HOME.tgz provides them.

If you want to create such a RPM_HOME directory,
set the RPM_HOME variable in your .bashrc or .cshrc or etc...
create the directory:
> mkdir -p $RPM_HOME
untar RPM_HOME.tgz inside:
> tar xvfz RPM_HOME.tgz -C $RPM_HOME

Add in your home dir these 2 files: 
1) .rpmmacros containing something like that:
--- cut here ---
%_topdir               /home/neyron/work/rpm
%_tmppath              /home/neyron/work/rpm/tmp

%_signature            gpg
%_gpg_name             Mandrake Linux
%_gpg_path             ~/.gnupg
%distribution          Mandrake Linux
%vendor                ID Laboratory
%perl_vendorlib %(eval "`perl -V:installvendorlib`"; echo $installvendorlib)
--- cut here ---

2) .rpmrc containing something like that:
--- cut here ---
buildarchtranslate: i386: i586
buildarchtranslate: i486: i586
buildarchtranslate: i586: i586
buildarchtranslate: i686: i586
--- cut here ---

This should now be fine to build rpms !

Enjoy.
