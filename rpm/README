If you want to generate RPM packages from the OAR sources:

    - untar the OAR archive and go into the new directory
    - go into the "rpm" directory
    - then copy the tar.gz into the directory "SOURCES"
    - then execute the command::

        rpmbuild -ba SPECS/oar.spec

    - the RPM packages are created into the "RPMS" directory
