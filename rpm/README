If you want to generate RPM packages from the OAR sources:

    - untar the OAR archive and go into the new directory
    - go into the "rpm" directory
    - then copy the tar.gz into the directory "SOURCES"
    - then execute the command::

        rpmbuild -ba SPECS/oar.spec

    - the RPM packages are created into the "RPMS" directory

yum install rpm-build
yum install rpmlint
yum install rpmdevtools

#mkdir -p SPECS SRPMS RPMS SOURCES BUILD
rpmdev-setuptree
cd rpmbuild

cp path/to/oar.spec SPECS/
cp path/to/oar.tgz SOURCES/
rpmbuild -bs SPECS/oar-X.spec
yum-builddep SRPMS/oar-X.src.rpm
