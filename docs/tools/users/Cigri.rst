Cigri
=====

The aim of the CiGri project is to gather the unused computing resource from intranet infrastructure and to make it available for large set of tasks.

It manages the execution of large sets of parametric tasks (>100K) on ligthweight grid by submitting individual jobs to each batch scheduler.

Itâ€™s associated to the oar resource management system (batch scheduler). Users can easily monitor and control their set of jobs through a web portal. System provides mecanisms to identify job error causes, to isolate faulty components and to resubmit job in a safer context. The CiGri server software is based on a database and offers a user interface for launching grid computations (scripts and web tools).
