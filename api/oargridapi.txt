#### Transitional api for oargrid ###
For now, oargridapi.pl is a wrapper to oargrid commands.
Oargrid is going to be integrated into the oar code subtree, but this is
a work still in progress.
So, even if the oar code embeds a new version of the oargrid lib, it's only
for the needs of oargridapi and you still need to install oargrid from the
old subtree (or package) to be able to use the api.

You need to adapt a bit your oargrid installation for this api to work:

# chgrp oar /etc/oargrid.conf
# chmod 640 /etc/oargrid.conf
