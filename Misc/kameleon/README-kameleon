Kameleon 0.01b :)

1. Install

   Checkout everything into one dir:
   https://scm.gforge.inria.fr/svn/oar/branches/gsoc-2009-kameleon/Misc/kameleon

   The only non-standard ruby module that's needes is "session" -- installation tarball can be found in:
   https://scm.gforge.inria.fr/svn/oar/branches/gsoc-2009-kameleon/Misc/kameleon/redist

   Upon extracting, session module can be installed by invoking "ruby install.rb" script.

2. Running kameleon

   Kameleon requires one command line argument: path to the recipe file.

   Example:
   $ sudo ./kameleon.rb recipes/debian-lenny-oar-2.4.yaml

   In order to be able to use "chroot", kameleon needs to be started as root (or with sudo).

3. Dir structure

   --/recipes
    |
    |/redist
    |
    |/steps/common
          |
          |/include
          |
          |/debian-lenny

   Since you pass path to the recipe file as a command line arg, recipes can be stored anywhere. Macrostep definitions, however, have to be stored in the dir structure under the "steps" dir.

   In the recipe file, under global->distrib, one defines distribution name. Kameleon uses that info to look for macrostep definition files under "<kameleon_root>/steps/$distrib/". If the file can't be found there, kameleon looks into "common" dir (one such example is /steps/common/clean.yaml).
