These are choices implemented for the compatibility between MySQL and PostrgreSQL:
==================================================================================

* All field and table names must be lowercase.
* MySQL AUTO_INCREMENT is replaced by PostgreSQL constraint sequence field.
* PostgreSQL does not implement UPDATE method on
  several tables (so we must make specific queries for each databases).
