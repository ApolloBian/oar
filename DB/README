These are choices implemented for the compatibility between MySQL and PostrgreSQL:
==================================================================================

* All field and table names must be lowercase
* MySQL AUTO_INCREMENT is replaced by PostgreSQL constraint sequence field (all
  inserts with such field are locked because we do not know if this action is
* atomic in PostgresSQL).  PostgreSQL does not implement UPDATE method on
  several tables (so we musti make specific queries for each databases).
