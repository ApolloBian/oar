oar (1.6) unstable; urgency=low

  * add the command "oaremovenode" that permits to delete a node of the
    database definitely
  * bug fix : now oarsub can read the user script even if oar has no right
  * now, you can use special value "all" in oarsub ("nodes" resource). It
    gives all free nodes corresponding to the weight and properties specified.
  * debug Gantt visualization
  * add the possibility to check nodes via nmap
  * add accounting features
  * change nodeState_log table scheme to increase rapidity

oar (1.5) unstable; urgency=low

  * debug reservation jobs (if the job has not the right amount requested
    nodes then it will wait a timeout. After it will be launched on rest
    nodes).
  * add a cache for visualization of the gantt scheme (add two gantt
    table for the visu)
  * add an event log mechanism. It permits to know all decisions and
    events that occure in OAR for jobs.
  * detection of errors (they can be treced via event_log table):
      - job working directory does not exist on the node
      - output files can not be created
  * add deploy scheduler awareness (schedule on non deploy nodes firstly)
  * possibility to change property value via oarnodesetting command (-p option)
  * add the command "oaremovenode" that permits to delete a node of the
    database definitely

oar (1.4) unstable; urgency=low

  *     add "DEPLOY_HOSTNAME" tag in oar.conf
        It specifies the node where OAR will be connected to submit a job in
        the deploy queue.
  *     "besteffort" jobs are now killed by the oar_meta_sched. It simplifies
        the write of schedulers (they do not care ab
        out "besteffort" jobs).
  *     bug fix about job startTime and stopTime (no more overlapping).

  *     Add a new module "finaud" : check every 5 minutes if "Suspected" are
        still suspected and "Alive" nodes are still alive.
