What can and must do a scheduler:
    - your program will get 3 arguments:
        1. queue name
        2. reference time in second
        3. reference time in sql format
    - you must manipulate only jobs in your queue and with their state =
      "Waiting" and "Reservation" = "None"
    - you can get all informations stored in the database (in read mode)
    - you have to load previous decisions of the other schedulers (load
      informations from tables gantt_jobs_predictions_ and
      gantt_jobs_resources_) or your decisions can conflict with previous.
    - you must store your decisions in the tables gantt_jobs_predictions_ and
      gantt_jobs_resources_
    - you can set state of jobs to "toError" and OAR will delete them. After
      you must exit from your program with "exit code" = 1 otherwise 0.

You can look at the default OAR scheduler "oar_sched_gantt_with_timesharing".
It uses a gantt and a resource tree libraries that are essential to take some
decisions.
