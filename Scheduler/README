What can and must do a scheduler:
    - your program will get 3 arguments:
        1: queue name
        2: reference time in second
        3: reference time in sql format
    - you must decide the scheduling of jobs in your queue with state = "Waiting" and "Reservation" = "None"
    - you can get all informations stored in the database
    - you must load previous decisions of other schedulers (load informations from tables "gantt_jobs_predictions" and "gantt_jobs_resources")
    - you must store your decisions in tables "gantt_jobs_predictions" and "gantt_jobs_resources"
    - you can set state of jobs to "toError" and OAR will delete them. After you must exit from your program with "exit code" = 1 otherwise 0.
