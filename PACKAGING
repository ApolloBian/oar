How to add files in the packages:
---------------------------------
Debian and RPM packages generation is based on the use of the main Makefile.

Hence, if new files, not yet packaged, must go into a .deb or .rpm, just modify
the main Makefile, and rebuild the packages (eg: use make debian-package and
make rpm-package).

The Makefile modification should be pretty staight forward: just add the
required lines in the correct Makefile target (eg: server, node, user, common,
drawgantt doc, ...).

How to update changelog:
------------------------
There are indeed 3 changelogs:

- OAR changelog, a.k.a. the main one, reflecting the changes in the sources.
  Versions are of the form x.y.z

- Debian changelog: this one reflects the changes in the debian packaging system.
  Versions are of the form x.y.z-t, were t is basically an integer number or
any meaning information with regards to package generation (for instance 1,
1.1, 1-cvsYYYYMMDD, etc...)
  Please use dch (or debchange) to edit the Debian changelog.

- RPM changelog: this one is used for Mandrake/Mandriva packaging.
  Versions are of the form x.y.z-t, just like for Debian.
  RPM changelogs are located at the end of the file rpm/oar.spec, feel free to
  use vi to edit it :).

The 3 changelogs have to be updated separatly.
