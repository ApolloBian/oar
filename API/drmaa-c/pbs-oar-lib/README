1) Install Torque (temporary step)
2) Install PBS-DRMAA
3) do cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" in the directory where you have the OAR-DRMAA source files(you have to replace the content of $OUT by the target where you have installed Torque)
4) do make in the same directory 
5) recompile the PBS-DRMAA (make clean => make)

6) Now, you can enjoy your self (don't forget to emulate the OAR-LIVE-CD (for example on Virtualbox) and to set a virtual network between your computer(HOST : INTERFACE tap0, IP 192.168.0.254, NETMASK 255.255.255.0) and the emulated OS (GUEST : INTERFACE eth1, IP 192.168.0.1, NETMASK 255.255.255.0))
