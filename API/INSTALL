Installation of the OAR RESTful user API
========================================

Configuring OAR
---------------
For the moment, the API needs the user tools to be installed on the same host ('make user-install' or oar-user package). A suitable /etc/oar/oar.conf should be present. For the API to work, you should have the oarstat/oarnodes/oarsub commands to work (on the same host you installed the API)

Installing the API files
------------------------
 - From sources: Download OAR and do "make api-install" as the root user.
 - From Debian packages: apt-get install oar-api
 - From RPM packages: yum install oar-api

Configuring apache
------------------
The api provides a default configuration file (/etc/oar/apache-api.conf) that
is using a identd user identification enabled only from localhost.
Edit the /etc/oar/apache-api.conf file and customize it to reflect the authentication mechanism you want to use. For ident, you may have to install a "identd" daemon on your distrib. The steps may be:
 - Install and run a identd daemon on your server
 - Activate the ident auth mechanism into apache (a2enmod ident)
 - Customize apache-api.conf to allow the hosts you trust for ident

YAML, JSON, XML
---------------
You need at least one of the YAML or JSON perl module to be installed on the host running the API.

Test
----
You may test the API with a simple wget:

 wget -O - http://localhost:/oarapi/resources.html

It should give you the list of resources in the yaml format but enclosed in an html page.
To test if the authentication works, you need to post a new job. See the example.txt file that gives you example queries with a ruby rest client.
