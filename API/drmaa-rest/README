  DRMAA-REST
  ==========

DRMAA-REST is a try to provide a DRMAA API for OAR based on REST approach.
So we need to provide a DRMAA on REST specification, and an implmentation 

See oar-wiki for global information on drmaa-rest

src/ will contain source.
doc/ will contain protocol specification.
test/ contains some preliminary test.
fake-server/ will contain a fake server side for development purpose.  

Fake server is based on several ruby components: sinatra, rack, thin, shoes and shotgun. The main one is sinatra (http://www.sinatrarb.com/) a micro-framework which allows to quick develop restfull web-application. 

Initialization step:

* install libraries see requirement
* Generate Makefile
  oar/trunk/API/drmaa-test/test$ cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" to generate Makefile


* Compilation:
  - enter in test or src and type make 


* Running
  - For test which need it, launch fake-server with: shoes ./shoes-and-a-shotgun.rb

Requirements

Librairies:

* libcurl3 - Multi-protocol file transfer library (OpenSSL)
* libcurl4-openssl-dev - Development files and documentation for libcurl (OpenSSL)

* libjson-glib-1.0-0 - GLib JSON manipulation library
* libjson-glib-dev - GLib JSON manipulation library (development files)

Tools for building process
* cmake - A cross-platform, open-source make system (use to generate Makefile)


Note: If you need modification in bulding process Makefile, you must adapt CMakeLists.txt (see cmake http://www.cmake.org/)
