Add besteffort and resource matching
------------------------------------

Besteffort support is a direct adaptation of the default oar scheduler from 2.3 series.
Need more tests and some discussions with Nicolas

TODO:
test on 2.3
deeper tests
better besteffort tests
error cases
no assignement found error (change job's state to error ???)
testing version without oar (modules compilation problems)
