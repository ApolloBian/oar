This is a SVG version of OAR Gantt diagram.
It was developped as a prototype to show how transparency (alpha colors) could be useful for rendering the resources usage.

This drawgantt unfortunately does not scale well above several tens of resources.
It is known to work quite well with recent version of Mozilla Firefox.

Use at your own risks.
