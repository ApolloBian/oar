Installing OAR in five steps
============================

Warning, the goal of this document is to explain how to install a typical OAR
system. To fine down the process, we will only treat the case where we install
all the OAR modules on an unique local machine. 
Of course an install of OAR in a real cluster environment is a bit more difficult
than that, but the principle is the same.
If you want more information about installing OAR in a cluster environment you
can refer to the INSTALL document.

Prerequisites: Install the libs
-------------------------------

First of all you have to install the following libs:

* Perl
* Perl-base
* openssh (server and client) version >= 3.9
* Perl-Mysql
* Perl-DBI
* MySQL
* libmysql

You also have to install a >= 2.6 kernel in order tu use cpuset feature.

1°) Pave the way for install
----------------------------

* add a user named "oar" in the group "oar"
* create a set of ssh keys for the user "oar" with ssh-keygen 
  (for instance 'id_dsa.pub' and 'id_dsa')
* copy these keys in the ".ssh" folder of the user "oar"
* append the contents of 'id_dsa.pub' to the file **~oar/.ssh/authorized_keys**
* in **~/.ssh/config** add the lines::

    Host *
        ForwardX11 no
        StrictHostKeyChecking no
        PasswordAuthentication no
        AddressFamily inet

* add in your ssh server config file::

    AcceptEnv OAR_CPUSET OAR_JOB_USER
    PermitUserEnvironment yes
    UseLogin no
    AllowUsers oar

* add::
  
    environment="OAR_KEY=1"
 
 at the beginning of your **~oar/.ssh/authorized_keys** file.
  
* add in your **~oar/.bashrc** file::

    export PATH=/usr/local/oar/oardodo:$PATH
    
2°) Install the OAR modules
---------------------------

Just go into the OAR source directory and as root type::

  make server-install user-install node-install
  
3°) Initiate the database
-------------------------

A script is available to do this, just launch as root: 
**/usr/local/sbin/oar_mysql_db_init**

4°) Configuration file
----------------------

The last thing you have to do is to configure your oar server. Its config file
is **/etc/oar/oar.conf**. Just edit it and take a look at the different sections
and customize it if you want to.

5°) Cpuset
----------

In order to use this feature, you first have to install Taktuk
(http://taktuk.gforge.inria.fr), a tool for deploying parallel remote executions
of commands. Then, you have to set the **TAKTUK_CMD field** in your oar.conf file 
and to uncomment the lines with the **PINGCHECKER_TAKTUK_ARG_COMMAND** and 
**JOB_RESOURCE_MANAGER_PROPERTY_DB_FIELD** fields.

Adding resources to the system
------------------------------

A script is available to help detecting resources on a local machine:
**/usr/local/oar/detect_resources**. You can use it to have an idea of how
works oarnodesetting. You may also type **oarnodesetting --help** as root for more
options.
