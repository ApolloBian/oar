oarnodecheck is a simple local node check mechanism working as follows:
* the oarnodecheckquery script is meant to be called by OAR ping checker, 
  to report the node health status. In OAR server's oar.conf:
  PINGCHECKER_TAKTUK_ARG_COMMAND="-t 3 broadcast exec [ oarnodecheckquery ]
* health status is bad as soon as one check log file is present in the checklog 
  directory (/var/lib/oar/checklogs)
* the directory of check scripts (/etc/oar/check.d/) is meant to contains admin
  defined scripts that perform checks with regard to possible errors 
* if and only if an error is detected, a checklog file must be created within
  the checklog directory (using the pathname defined by the CHECKLOGFILE
  environmenet variable)
* the oarnodecheckcron must be run by cron (/etc/cron.hourly for instance) to
  execute all scripts of the directory of check scripts
* the oarnodechecklist command lists the currently recorder check logs
See the template script for a template of check script to place in the
directory of check scripts (/etc/oar/check.d)
