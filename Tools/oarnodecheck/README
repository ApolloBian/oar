This directory contains a simple node local check mechanism as follows:
* the oarnodecheckquery script is meant to be called by OAR ping checker, 
  to report the node health status (see oar.conf)
* health status is bad as soon as one checklog file is present in the checklog 
  directory (/var/lib/oar/checklogs)
* the checkscript directory (/etc/oar/checkscripts/) directory contains admin
  defined scripts that perform checks with regard to eventual errors 
* if and only if an error is detected, a checklog file is created within the
  checklog directory
* the oarnodecheckcron must be run by cron (/etc/cron.hourly for instance) to
  execute all scripts of the checkscripts directory
* the oarnodechecklist script lists the currently recorder checklogs
See the templatecheck.sh script for a template of check script to place in the
checkscript directory
