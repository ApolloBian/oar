These are the steps to perform when you want to release a new version of OAR:

 1. Commit your changes in the svn. (put the right version number into
    Tools/oarversion.pm)

 2. Make a tag (for sources and Debian packaging) with the number that you want
    to assign. For example::

        svn cp branches/2.2 tags/2.2.5
        svn cp Debian/branch-2.2 Debian/tags/2.2.5

    This example creates the tag "2.2.5" from the branch "2.2"

 2. Use the *build_tgz.sh* script to create the right archive. For example::

        ./build_tgz tags/2.2.5

    This example creates the archive "oar-2.2.5.tgz".

    See '--help' option for more features.

 3. Create Debian packages. Go to the *Debian* directory and use
    *build-debian.rb*. For example::

        ./build-debian.rb ../oar-2.2.5.tgz

    Everything is created into the *build-area* directory.
