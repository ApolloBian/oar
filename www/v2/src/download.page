h2. Download


h3. Installation

See the "documentation page":docs/manual.html#installing-the-oar-batch-system for installation requirements and instructions.

h3. Debian packages

You can use the debian repository in your sources.list

 deb http://oar.imag.fr/download ./

or

 Download sources and debian packages on https://gforge.inria.fr/frs/?group_id=125

The system is licensed under the *GNU Library General Public License*.

h3. Optional Software

    * "Taktuk":http://taktuk.gforge.inria.fr/ is a parallel and scalable remote execution tool for cluster.

h3. USB bootable key image for x86 computers (_work in progress_)

"oar_usb_live_demo_20071203.img":oar_usb_live_demo_20071203.img (380M, md5: 2cb857e7bfb379d895b32c975b3d22d9) : dump me on an USB key (oar version 2.2.10).

Suggested steps to follow:

        * Copy the image on an usb key (this will erase all the content of your key):
            
  dd if=oar_usb_live_demo_20071203.img of=/dev/device_name_of_your_usb_key

And then you can boot your computer from your USB key.

You can also test it via "Qemu":http://fabrice.bellard.free.fr/qemu/ if it is working under your system
            
  qemu -m 256 -hda oar_usb_live_demo_20071203.img

        * Then, if everything's ok, you will be in a Xfce graphical desktop with a Firefox browser and a terminal.
        * From now you can use OAR commands in the terminal and see web interfaces in the web navigator
  
  oarsub -I
  ...
  oarsh localhost

        * If you want to go ahead with OAR utilization, you can take a look at the "documentation page":docs/manual.html.
          For example, if you have a dual processor computer you can execute:

  sudo oarnodesetting -a -h localhost -p cpuset=1

This will add the cpu 1 into the system (refresh web interfaces in the browser)

        * You can boot several computers with this key and then choose one as OAR server and then add them into OAR via oarnodesetting (be aware that there won't be a network filesystem mounted (like NFS), so each files will be local to computers).

h3. ComputeMode virtual cluster solution

"ComputeMode":http://www.computemode.org uses OAR internally for the jobs management.
