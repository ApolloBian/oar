title: Google Summer Of code
---
h2. 2008 Edition

During the summer 2008, OAR software took part on the Google Summer of Code event
(see http://code.google.com/soc/2008/ for further details).
We've participated successfully and we got two students to work upon two different project proposals. The final code produced can be found here: http://code.google.com/p/google-summer-of-code-2008-oar/ .
The work done during gsoc 2008 by our two students is now integrated in our current development branch and will be released soon.
You can take a look at the students work's reviews:
